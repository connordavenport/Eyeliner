# Eyeliner


RoboFont extension that highlights points that are aligned with vertical metrics or guides. Feel reassured that your points are aligned, without having to zoom in and check.

Eyeline shapes will match the appropriate color of whatever line it's aligning to, based on the color preferences you have set in RoboFont.

Eyeline currently only shows alignment to vertical metrics or 0°/90° guides.
